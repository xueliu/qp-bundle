About this Example
==================
This example demonstrates staring and stopping active objects multiple times
during the runtime, as opposed to starting AOs only at the beginning.

The code for the example is generated automatically by the QM modeling tool
(QM version 4.5.0 or higher).

The start-stop application consists of two AOs:

- the Launcher AO is started at the beginning and its job is to periodically
  (re)start another AO

- the Worker AO is NOT started at the beginning, but instead it is
  instantiated and started by the Launcher AO.

The actual visible work is performed by the Worker AO, which blinks the
yellow LED (LD1) on the NUCLEO-H743ZI board. After blinking the LED five
times, the Worker AO publishes turns the blue LED (LD2), publishes the
 DONE event and stops itself (by calling QActive::stop() on itself).

The Launcher AO subscribes to the DONE event. Upon reception of this event,
The Launcher AO gives the Worker a bit of time (at least one clock tick)
to cleanly terminate and then it explicitly destroys the Worker. The Worker
destructor turns the blue LED (LD2) off.

Next the Launcher instantiates the Worker AO by means of the placement new
operator and then it starts it again to repeat the cycle, which goes no
forever.


NOTES:
------
Because this application is intended for embedded real-time systems,
it does not use the dynamic memory (heap). Instead it uses statically
allocated memory (static mode of FreeRTOS) as well as placement new
and explicit destructor call.

It is possible to use the standard new and delete operators with the
standard heap, or some customized memory allocation (overloaded new/delete).
This goes beyond the scope of this example.


Supported Toolchains
====================
This example contains sub-directories for building it with various
toolchains. The following toolchains are supported:

arm
gnu
iar

Please refer to the README.txt files in these sub-directories for
more information about building and running the examples.


QP/Spy Support
==============
This example demonstrates the QP/Spy software tracing in the Spy
build configuration. The QP/Spy uses the virtual COM port provided
by the NUCLEO-H743ZI board. To see the QP/Spy output, you need to launch
the qspy host utility, as follows (Windows command prompt):

qspy -u -c COM4

where COM4 is the particular virtual serial port registered by your
NUCLEO board. You need to adjust the COM port number for your machine.


Programming the NUCLEO Board
============================
The NUCLEO boards appear as a USB-flash drive in the file system.
Programming of the board is done by simply copying the binary into
thy flash drive letter.

For example, assuming that the NUCLEO board appears as drive E:, 
you program it with the following command:

copy dbg\start-stop.bin E:
