To use the QTools, you first need to **build** the tools on your machine.

For example, to build the QSPY host application, you need to go to the
directory qtools/qspy/posix and type make to build the executable. The
provided Makefile will automatically copy the qspy executable to the
qtools/bin directory.

Simiarly, you need to build the QCLEAN and QFSGEN utilities.
