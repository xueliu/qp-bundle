TclUDP
======

This package provides UDP sockets for Tcl.

INSTALLATION
============

This package uses the Tcl Extension Architecture (TEA). Please see the
web page

    http://www.tcl.tk/doc/tea/

for more information about TEA.

UNIX BUILD
==========

Building under most UNIX systems is easy, just run the configure script
and then run make. For more information about the build process, see
the tcl/unix/README file in the Tcl src dist. 

Following examples use the tclConfig.sh script. This script comes with the
installation of Tcl and contains useful data about the installation.

Linux
-----

To install Tcl, use e.g. 'apt-get|yum install tcl-devel.<platform> tcllib'.
The tclConfig.sh script is located in the folder /usr/lib/

	$ cd tcludp
	$ ./configure --with-tcl=/usr/lib/
	$ make
	$ make test
	$ make install

MacOSX
------
To install Tcl, use e.g. ActiveState Tcl distribution. The tclConfig.sh script
is located in the folder /Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/

	$ cd tcludp
	$ ./configure --with-tcl=/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/
	$ make
	$ make test
	$ make install

WINDOWS BUILD
=============

See the tcl/win/README file included in the Tcl src dist for details
about how to build the extension under Windows. We suggest using
the Msys + Mingw build process since it is significantly easier
than building with VC++ or Cygwin.

This package includes a Visual Studio project file to help in building
with VC++.

The package has been built using both VC++6 and Msys + Mingw. 

Microsoft Platform SDK 2003 is required for building. The following minimal
example will install the extension in the C:\Tcl\lib directory.

	$ cd tcludp/win
	$ nmake -f makefile.vc realclean all 
	$ nmake -f makefile.vc install INSTALLDIR=C:\Tcl\lib

DOCUMENTATION BUILD
===================

Use the following command to create the UNIX documentation (based on udp.man file):

	$ cd tcludp
	$ ./tools/mpexpand.tcl nroff ./doc/udp.man ./doc/udp.n
	$ nroff -man ./doc/udp.n
